hi, i am data, but you may call me whatever. i also go by kirk, or q. i would prefer you use no pronouns on me, however if you are more comfortable using a set, please go right ahead. i am slavic or russian-american, and 16. currently, i am interested in: star trek, supernatural, modern family, and threshold (the 2005 series). i am an angelkin and androidkin, (plus various animal kins), fox kemonomimi, and my (character) kins are: castiel (supernatural), data soong, james t. kirk, and sherlock hound. my favourite colour is green, any shade of green, favourite animal is the great-horned owl and dragonfish, favourite songs are "halo" by depeche mode, and "silverspoon" by louden swain (specifically the acoustic version). my favourite show is threshold, if you havent seen it i beg of you to! i do not know anyone other than myself and my partner who likes the show. if you are into sci-fi, aliens or space i would highly recommend it! some of my other interests and what-not: aliens, space, birds, autumn or winter, cats, x-men, angels/angelology and biblical studies, zombies, bones, christmas, the ocean, gravity falls, and spiderman.
